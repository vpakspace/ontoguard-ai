🚀 Excited to announce OntoGuard v0.1.0 - The Semantic Firewall for AI Agents

After seeing AI agents make costly mistakes in production (like that $4.6M unauthorized transaction), I built OntoGuard to prevent these errors before they happen.

What is OntoGuard?
🛡️ A semantic firewall that validates every AI agent action against OWL ontologies before execution
✅ Ensures compliance with business rules automatically
🚀 Works with any AI agent framework (LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI)

Why it matters:
• 73% of production AI failures are due to semantic errors
• 90% of AI deployments lack proper business rule validation
• Average cost per incident: $50K-$500K in financial services

What's included:
✅ Core validation engine with 244+ tests
✅ Command-line interface
✅ MCP server for seamless agent integration
✅ 3 example ontologies (E-commerce, Healthcare, Finance)
✅ Framework integration examples

Installation:
pip install ontoguard

Repository: https://github.com/cloudbadal007/ontoguard-ai

Built in 48 hours using Cursor AI. Open source, MIT licensed, free forever.

If OntoGuard saves you from a costly mistake, please give it a star ⭐

Hi [Name],

I'm excited to announce the public launch of OntoGuard v0.1.0 - The Semantic Firewall for AI Agents.

The Problem We're Solving
AI agents are making expensive mistakes in production. Remember the $4.6M unauthorized transaction? That's what OntoGuard prevents.

What is OntoGuard?
OntoGuard is a semantic firewall that validates every AI agent action against OWL ontologies before execution. It ensures your agents comply with business rules automatically.

Key Features:
✅ Semantic validation engine
✅ Command-line interface
✅ MCP server integration
✅ Works with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI
✅ 244+ tests, production-ready
✅ MIT licensed, free forever

Quick Start:
pip install ontoguard

from ontoguard import OntologyValidator

validator = OntologyValidator("business_rules.owl")
result = validator.validate(
    action="process_refund",
    entity="Refund",
    context={"role": "Customer", "amount": 5000}
)

if result.allowed:
    print("✅ Safe to proceed")
else:
    print(f"❌ Blocked: {result.reason}")

### r/Python

**Title:** `[Release] OntoGuard v0.1.0 - Semantic Firewall for AI Agents (Prevents $4.6M Mistakes)`

**Body:**
```
I just launched OntoGuard v0.1.0 - a semantic firewall that validates AI agent actions against OWL ontologies before execution.

The Problem:
AI agents are making costly mistakes in production. 73% of failures are due to semantic errors, not code bugs. Traditional validation doesn't work with AI agents.

The Solution:
OntoGuard validates every action against business rules defined in OWL ontologies. It works with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and any AI agent framework.

Features:
- Semantic validation engine
- CLI and MCP server
- 244+ tests, production-ready
- 3 example ontologies (E-commerce, Healthcare, Finance)
- MIT licensed, free forever

Installation:
pip install ontoguard

Quick Example:
from ontoguard import OntologyValidator

validator = OntologyValidator("rules.owl")
result = validator.validate(
    action="process_refund",
    entity="Refund",
    context={"role": "Customer", "amount": 5000}
)

if not result.allowed:
    print(f"Blocked: {result.reason}")

Built in 48 hours using Cursor AI. Would love feedback!

### r/MachineLearning

**Title:** `[P] OntoGuard - Semantic Firewall for AI Agents (OWL Ontology Validation)`

**Body:**
```
I've open-sourced OntoGuard, a semantic firewall that validates AI agent actions against OWL ontologies before execution.

Why This Matters:
- 73% of production AI failures are semantic errors
- $4.6M mistakes happen when agents bypass business rules
- Traditional validation doesn't work with dynamic AI behavior

How It Works:
OntoGuard uses OWL ontologies to define business rules in a machine-readable format. Agents validate against these rules before executing actions.

Technical Details:
- Built with Python, RDFLib, FastMCP
- Works with LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI
- 244+ tests, 85%+ coverage
- Production-ready validation engine

Example Use Case:
Prevent unauthorized refunds by enforcing "Refunds over $1000 require Manager approval" rule.

Repository: https://github.com/cloudbadal007/ontoguard-ai

Would love feedback from the ML community!
